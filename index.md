# /Monitoring

You are concerned about the reliability of your systems, services, and products. Where should you start?

In this session, you’ll get an introduction to modern operations disciplines and a framework for reliability work. We jump into monitoring: the foundational practice you must tackle before you can make any headway with reliability. Using Tailwind Traders as an example, we’ll demonstrate how to monitor your environment, including the right (and wrong) things to monitor – and why. You’ll leave with the crucial tools and knowledge you need to discuss and improve reliability using objective data.

# /Incident Response

**Your systems are down!**

Customers are calling. Every moment counts. What do you do? Handling incidents well is core to meeting your reliability goals.

In this session, we will explore incident management best practices that will help you triage, remediate, and communicate as effectively as possible.

We will also explore the tools Azure provides to get you back into a working state when time is of the essence.
