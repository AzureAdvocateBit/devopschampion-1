# Communication Coordinator

The Communication Coordinator is meant to be the person working in conjunction with the incident commander to share more information beyond those who are in the firefight actively working to recover from the incident itself. That could be customers. It could be the sales and marketing teams. Maybe your customer support. There are many people within an organization who need to be made aware of what’s taking place and the status around how things are progressing. It's always good to put someone in charge of managing that communication and making sure that other stakeholders are aware of what is happening and what’s being done.
