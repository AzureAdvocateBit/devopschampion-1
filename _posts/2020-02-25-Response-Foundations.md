# Response Foundations

If we are going to talk about the foundations of building reliable systems including the foundations of a good incident response plan, I think the best place to start is by determining “Who is expected to respond to problems?” and “How do let them know?” The best place to start, is to design what is known as a “Roster” or an on-call team. We’ll talk more about rosters in a moment. First, we’ll talk about some of the “Roles” of the people that make up that “Roster”.  And last, we’ll talk about what a rotation is.
