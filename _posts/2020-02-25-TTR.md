# Time to Recover/Remediate/Restore (TTR)

How many of you are familiar with the acronym T. T. R.?

It is known as the “Time to Recover” or also sometimes referred to as the “time to remediate” or “time to restore.”

In other words, the total time that it takes for us to bring services back online… with regards to the value we provide our end users and customers. What is the duration?

This is just one metric that is often measured to understand how teams are performing when it comes to responding to incidents.

I think you would all agree that complete prevention of problems is not very realistic.  

We must do better at knowing when something is wrong and being able to respond to it in an effective way.
