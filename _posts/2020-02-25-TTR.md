# Time to Recover/Remediate/Restore (TTR)

Are you familiar with the acronym T. T. R.?

It is known as the “Time to Recover” or also sometimes referred to as the “time to remediate” or “time to restore.”

In other words, the total time that it takes for engineers to bring services back online… with regards to the value we provide our end users and customers. What is the duration?

While not a perfect metric, certainly one in which organizations can begin to measure how teams are performing when it comes to responding to incidents.

I think you would all agree that the complete prevention of problems is not very realistic.  

We must do better at knowing when something is wrong and being able to respond to it in an effective way.
