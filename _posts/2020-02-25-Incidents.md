# What is an incident

## Service disruption

I think we should fist discuss what we mean by incidents so we can come to a general understanding for today’s presentation.

I am confident everyone would agree that an incident is a “service disruption” - something that is affecting our user's ability to use the services they have come to rely on.

Incidents are commonly...

### Feared and Avoided  

In some cases, we downplay the significance of an outage ... or worse ... intentionally mis-label or not report a disruption in service for fear of reprimand.

Historically, we have felt that incidents reflected poorly in several areas of our engineering efforts and the organization.  

It is not been until more recently through many of the conversations around devops and site reliability engineering, that we are starting to rethink incidents and now view them as opportunities to learn and improve our systems.

Incidents can also be...

## Subjective

If you ask engineers across different organizations and industries, you will get many different answers about what an incident is.

Sometimes it is only when a customer is affected.

Others will label disruptions as incidents even if a customer never experienced a thing.

Subjectivity is an unfortunate property of incidents in a lot of cases, even when it comes to identifying severity levels.

The last thing I want to point out regarding incidents, is that most of what we as engineers and technologists do is planned work.  

We spend a lot of time and effort understanding the work in front of us.  

We calculate story points.  We plan sprints. We mostly have a good idea on what we are supposed to be working on.

So, when an incident occurs, it is disruptive. It is...

### Unplanned Work  

Often, we view this as a terrible thing, but if you stop and think about it, incidents are really “investments” in supplying the value we are trying to deliver to end users.
