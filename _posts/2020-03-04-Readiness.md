# Readiness

During and after a post-incident review many ideas will surface around how to improve not only various aspects of each phase of the lifecycle but also how the team can improve in other areas. Communication for example. During the review engineers might have pointed out that there were long gaps in the conversation timeline where nobody said anything. It's helpful to be verbose in what engineers are doing, thinking, even feeling. If someone isn't completely comfortable following the steps from documentation, we should address that. Who else on the team carries fears about performing actions on the system during an incident? We want our team to be confident and ready.

So, what did we learn that helps improve that readiness? Action items aren't the point of the exercise. Some engineering efforts will emerge as a result of the conversations. Adding telemetry to help keep a better eye on the credit card processing system, for example. 

Product and engineering teams should work together to prioritize and schedule work for those enhancements. Tradeoffs will be made since the uptime of a new feature is just as important as the feature itself. Ultimately, what's best for the business is what leadership will have to wrestle with.

The bigger win that helps with our readiness efforts is that we have measurements by which we can set goals around.
